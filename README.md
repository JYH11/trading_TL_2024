## Project Introduction
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an algorithmic trading engine that leverages advanced communication protocols and integrates various subsystems. This engine aims to simulate and execute trading strategies efficiently, providing a practical platform for applying algorithmic trading principles in real-world financial markets.

The initial phase focuses on:
- Designing and implementing a trading engine.
- Interfacing with multiple brokers and exchange APIs to collect real-time market data.
- Storing data efficiently for both backtesting and live trading.
- Testing trading strategies using historical data and simulated market conditions.
- Executing trades based on signals from an ensemble of trading strategies.
