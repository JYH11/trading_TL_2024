TECHLAUNCHER 2024

PROJECT INTRODUCTION
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an algorithmic trading engine that leverages advanced communication protocols and integrates various subsystems to simulate and execute trading strategies efficiently. This engine will serve as a platform for understanding and applying algorithmic trading principles in the real-world financial market. 

In the initial phase, the focus will be on designing and implementing a robust trading engine capable of interacting with multiple brokers and exchange APIs to collect real-time market data, storing this data efficiently for backtesting and live trading strategies, testing trading strategies using historical data and simulated market conditions and executing trades based on signals generated form an ensemble of trading strategies.
