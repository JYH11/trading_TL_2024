## Project Introduction
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an algorithmic trading engine that leverages advanced communication protocols and integrates various subsystems to simulate and execute trading strategies efficiently. This engine will serve as a platform for understanding and applying algorithmic trading principles in the real-world financial market.

In the initial phase, the focus will be on designing and implementing a robust trading engine capable of interacting with multiple brokers and exchange APIs to collect real-time market data, storing this data efficiently for backtesting and live trading strategies, testing trading strategies using historical data and simulated market conditions, and executing trades based on signals generated from an ensemble of trading strategies.

## Current Status & Future Plans
**As of now, our project is in the research and design phase.** We are actively working on the architecture and planning the overall system. This stage involves extensive research and careful planning to ensure the success of subsequent phases.

### Why does the repository seem empty?
- **Research & Design Phase:** We are currently in the research phase. This involves deep dives into algorithmic trading concepts, market analysis, and technology stack decisions. This phase is crucial for laying a strong foundation for the project.
- **Upcoming Coding Stage:** We expect to start coding in a few weeks. This will include the development of the trading engine, integration with APIs, and implementation of trading strategies.
