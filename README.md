## TRADING: FINANCIAL MARKET & ALGORITHMIC TRADING
### TECHLAUNCHER 2024 

---

## Project Introduction
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an algorithmic trading engine that leverages advanced communication protocols and integrates various subsystems to simulate and execute trading strategies efficiently. This engine will serve as a platform for understanding and applying algorithmic trading principles in the real-world financial market.

In the initial phase, the focus will be on designing and implementing a robust trading engine capable of interacting with multiple brokers and exchange APIs to collect real-time market data, storing this data efficiently for backtesting and live trading strategies, testing trading strategies using historical data and simulated market conditions, and executing trades based on signals generated from an ensemble of trading strategies.

## Current Status & Future Plans
**As of now, our project is in the research and design phase.** We are actively working on the architecture and planning the overall system. This stage involves extensive research and careful planning to ensure the success of subsequent phases.

### Why Does the Repository Seem Empty?
- **Early Development Stage:** Currently, our efforts are concentrated on the initial stages of development, which involve a significant amount of planning and groundwork that may not yet result in substantial code commits.
- **Focus on Non-Coding Aspects:** A large part of our initial work involves setting up infrastructure, designing database schemas, and planning communication protocols, which are critical yet less visible on GitHub.
- **Upcoming Implementation Phase:** We are preparing to transition from the planning stage to actual coding and implementation. This will soon result in more tangible updates and commits to the repository.
